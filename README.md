Campfire was used to interface with 37signals web application.  I was going to try and sell it before they bought out someone else and then offered the application for free.  Here's the code from back in 2010.  It's quite a bit dated now.  You need a valid campfire account to be able to login and use the application.

Technical Details:

This was originally developed against iOS 3.0.  It has been updated to compile against iOS 5.0.  iOS development has changed drastically since 2010.  You will notice a lot of the old school memory management that is taking place.  Blocks weren't even introduced yet.  From what I understand a lot of the patterns remain the same.  Unit testing is extremely difficult at the time as well.
